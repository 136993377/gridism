# Gridism

A simple responsive CSS grid. [View the demo →](http://cobyism.com/gridism/)

## Overview

- **Simple**—Each `.grid` element is a horizontal row which can contain `.unit` elements of various widths. Width combinations are detailed below.
- **Responsive**—Units get stacked on screens 568px or smaller. Grids in a `.wrap` have maximum widths of 978px, or 1140px when there’s lots of room.
- **Easy**—All units have even inner and outer gutters. You can turn gutters off with `.no-gutters`. There are also a few other commonly needed classes for things like alignment, floating, and hiding things.
